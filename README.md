## Introduction
In the Humpback Whale Identification kaggle competition we are challenged to build an algorithm to identifying whale species in images.
### Dataset description
The data base includes 4251 whale calsses:
- [ ] 4250 whale IDs
	- about half of these classes contain only 1 sample
- [ ] 'new_whale' class specifing unidentified whales
	- this class contains 630 images

** An 'inverse' histogram of the dataset:**

- x - axis: quantity

- y - axis: number of classes wich holds that quantity

**Images from the data set for example:**

### Competition's score evaluation
Submission is done by a 'csv' file containing maximum 5 ID estimations for each 
image in the test set. The score is evaluated by:

Wich is the mean average precission 
Where U is the total number of images , n is the number of estimations for each image, and P(k) is the percission 
of the estimation defined by TP/(TP+FP). In our case we belive it is calculated simply by:

### Hardware
The NNs where trained on a personal computer with GeforceRTX2060 GPU wich is equivalent TBD

## Implementation
This section is divided to kaggle submissions, thus describing our work in layers.
### Submission #0
#### Dataset
* Ignoring classes with less than 5 samples
* Randomly splitting to train-val with 25% val.

run `dataset_2_train_val_subfolders`

#### PreProcessing
* Random resize crop
* Random horizontal flip
* Normalization


#### Network Architecture
Resnet50 with last layer FC with 313 features (Number of whales with more then 5 occurances)
#### Results
Whale competiton score of **0.324**
This is a pretty good score for a very simple implementation!
**But** examining the network's output reveals that we went into a **loacl minima** where all
highest probabilities are 'new_whale'

| Image         | Id            |
| ------------- |:-------------:|

#### Conclusions and ToDO's
- [ ] find a way out of new_whale local minima
### Submission #1

#### Dataset
* Taking in account all classes
* Randomly splitting to train-val with 25% val.

run `dataset_2_train_val_subfolders`

#### PreProcessing
* Random resize crop
* Random horizontal flip
* Normalization


#### Network Architecture
Resnet50 with last layer FC with 4251 features 
#### Results
Whale competiton score of 0.008
